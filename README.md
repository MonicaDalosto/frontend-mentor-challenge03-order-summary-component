## My process

- I started on the Html file, adding the semantic elements;
- I had imported the fonts and created some variables to identify the font-family and the colors;
- I tried to style the elements on CSS using classes instead of the html elements, so I chose the properly class names;
- The project is desktop first (screen: 1440px);
- I had used Flexbox to position the elements on the screen, before I started the stylization;
- Then I styled the elements from the top to the bottom;
- Add the hover states;
- Add the responsiveness to the mobile screens (375px);

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've practiced how to create and use the variables in CSS and the flexbox tools;

### Continued development

- Practice more the flexbox tools;
- Learn how to code Utility Firts CSS, because I tried on this project, but didn't work so well;
